## Code test for Yieldify Frontend Engineer 28-11-2019

## Getting Started

This project is downloadable from github:

      git clone ...

To start the project locally first:

- install the dependancies:

      npm install

- then

      npm start

_**Note**: Node.js is required to run the project_

Alternatively visit the working [project](https://rennzie.github.io/code-test-yieldify-bouncing-balls/)

## Task

## Plan

This section is a rough outline of the thought process I followed to acomplish the task.

- [x] Set-up project with tooling which helps minimise small bugs. Eslint etc
- [x] Build a contained which adds a ball on click
- [x] Make sure multiple balls can be added
- [x] Set the start position of the ball based on click
- [x] Get the balls to drop after they appear in the container
- [x] ~~Create a gravity function?~~
- [x] Remove the ball from the container when it reaches the bottom
- [x] Make the ball change direction when it hits the bottom
- [x] create a gravitational effect so ball speeds up when going down and slows down when moving up
- [x] get gravity to reduce the velocity with time, so the ball eventually sits on the bottom
- [x] remove the ball once its on the bottom and its velocity is 0;
- [x] start the ball off on a random velocity when it mounts
- [x] set an angle and change the horizontal position as the ball drops
- [x] randomise all the start inputs
- [x] change horizontal direction on vertical wall collision
- primary task complete. Now for some additions and imporovements
- [x] improve the energy decay, it should fade itself over time. look at actuall gravity
- [ ] ~~improve perfomance by only having one renderer: try a timer display, not sure react will like this?~~
- [x] refactor the useMovement, add comments and test critical components
- [x] make the display a bit more fun and add some instructions
- [ ] ~~allow the user to power up the ball on a long click hold~~
- [x] add Yieldify favicon√å
- [x] publish to github pages

### Components and hooks

1. `Container`
   - Parent which holds number of balls
2. `Ball`
   - Rendered on click. Position changes relative to the parent as a function of movement control
3. `useMovment`
   - handles the changing movement of the ball based on its initial start position
4. `useDirection`
   - handles the balls direction and changing it when needed
5. `useVelocity`
   - handles the balls velocity. Calculates its x and y component velocity depending on a given angle
