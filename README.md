## Code test for Yieldify Frontend Engineer 22-11-2019

## Getting Started

This project is downloadable from github:

      git clone ...

To start the project locally first:

- install the dependancies:

      npm install

- then

## Plan

This section is a rough outline of the thought process I followed to acomplish the task.

- [x] Set-up project with tooling which helps minimise small bugs. Eslint etc
- [x] Build a contained which adds a ball on click
- [x] Make sure multiple balls can be added
- [x] Set the start position of the ball based on click
- [x] Get the balls to drop after they appear in the container
      (Create a gravity function?)
- [x] Remove the ball from the container when it reaches the bottom
- [x] Make the ball change direction when it hits the bottom
- [x] create a gravitational effect so ball speeds up when going down and slows down when moving up
- [x] get gravity to reduce the velocity with time, so the ball eventually sits on the bottom
- [x] remove the ball once its on the bottom and its velocity is 0;
- [ ] start the ball off on a random velocity when it mounts
- [ ] set an angle and change the horizontal position as the ball drops

### Components and hooks

ÃŸ

1. `Container`
   - Parent which holds number of balls
2. `Ball`
   - Rendered on click. Position changes relative to the parent as a function of movement control
3. `useMovment`
   - handles the chaning movement of the ball based on its initial start position
